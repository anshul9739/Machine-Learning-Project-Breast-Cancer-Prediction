# 🧬 Machine Learning Project: Breast Cancer Prediction  

This project is a **Flask + Machine Learning web app** that predicts whether a tumor is **Malignant (cancerous)** or **Benign (non-cancerous)** based on diagnostic features.  
It uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**, one of the most widely used datasets for medical ML research.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It is **not a medical tool** and should not be used for diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features
- Clean and responsive **Bootstrap 5 UI**  
- Input diagnostic features such as:
  - `texture_mean`  
  - `perimeter_mean`  
  - `smoothness_mean`  
  - `compactness_mean`  
  - `symmetry_mean`  
- Model outputs:
  - **Prediction** → Malignant / Benign  
  - **Confidence / Probability**
